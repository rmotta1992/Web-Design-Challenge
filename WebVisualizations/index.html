      <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze hoe weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
        To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherAPI to assemble a dataset for over 
        500 cities.</p>

        <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot varius aspects of the weather vs. latitude.
          Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humiditiy. This site provides the 
          source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions 
          of any trends and correlations witnessed.</p>
